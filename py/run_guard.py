"""Limits a cold runner enforces inside its own launches.

A launch is otherwise bounded only by its wall-clock budget, which for a one-session
suite is the whole suite's: one level that loses its way can hold a worker -- and the
machine's memory -- for hours before anything stops it. The guard here is consulted
once a poll by gdtas.worker.run_session and ends that launch (only the processes started
from under the worker's own directory) when

  * the level in play has run past its deadline, or
  * the machine's available physical memory is below a floor.

It also keeps what is needed to say where the level was when it was stopped: the last
`[fp]` iteration line, the last death line, the last coin line, the last solver argv,
and the child's working set. Samples of free memory and the child's working set are
appended to a JSON-lines file so the run leaves a record even when nothing is stopped.

The deadline comes from the caller. cold_regress.py picks it from the previous run's
longest level times a factor (see `pick_deadline`), or takes it from the command line.
