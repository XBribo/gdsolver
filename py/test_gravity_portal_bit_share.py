"""Sharing a gravity-portal latch bit past kGravPortalBits, step by step (no game needed).

State::portalLatch has 128 bits. A level with more gravity portals used to be refused; now,
on a level with no reversal, the portal 128 later in x order takes the bit of the one before
it, and the step clears the bit where x crosses the point between the two
(dp/src/dp/prelude.hpp, g_gpHandoff). Two real levels clearing proves none of the steps
below on its own, so each is pinned here.

The fixture is 130 normal-gravity portals (id 10, type 4) every 60 px along the ground and a
cube that walks through all of them without a press. A normal portal leaves an upright
cube's gravity alone, but GD latches a gravity portal on its first overlap whether or not
it flips anything, so every portal sets its bit and nothing else changes. Portal 0 and
portal 128 share bit 0, portal 1 and portal 129 bit 1.

    1. portal 0 is entered unspent and sets bit 0
    2. bit 0 is still set before the hand-over point and clear after it
    3. portal 128 is entered unspent -- without the hand-over it would read as spent
    4. an anchor past the hand-over that names portal 0 as spent does not set bit 0
    5. a reversal, or a pair closer than the sharing gap, is refused as before; 128 portals
       share nothing

Read from --slopedbg: the loader's `gpbit` lines (uid -> bit) and the portal pass's
`gplatch` lines (the bit, whether it was spent coming in, and the incoming mask).
The second body's mask (portalLatch2) is cleared by the same statement and is not
exercised: none of the levels that need sharing has a dual.
